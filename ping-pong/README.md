Table tennis HTML5 2d canvas (+ sound) demo
===========================================

This very small JavaScript project doesn't aim at:

* presenting the best practices on the use of the JavaScript programming language,
* implementing a very good (or even thorough) game loop,
* showing a proper use of programming practices in general.

What it does aim at is:

* presenting an example of the use of the HTML5 canvas (as learned in a couple of hours),
* showing readable (and linted) JavaScript code,
* showing that something fun can be easily achieved with minimal effort!

Getting Started
---------------

`git clone` this repo to your local environment and open file `pingpong/pingpong.html`
with your favorite browser.

Contributions
-------------

I accept Pull Requests and issues to improve this :-)

Credits
-------
We almost never do anything by ourselves, let alone invent something new:

* all sounds courtesy of [freesound.org](freesound) with minimal manipulation,
* thanks to Mary Rose Cook for showing me this is fun and easy,
* thanks to Douglas Crockford for all the JavaScript lessons,
* thanks to my fellow players that, like me, spent countless hours in front of
flashing lights and some sounds and stories.

What more can I expect?
-----------------------

If you browse the JavaScript code you'll find some hidden goodies (and also too many
magic numbers!).

Changelog
